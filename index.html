                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">According to Mr. Lavrov, USA-Russian relations are a conversation between the dumb and the deaf. Objectively, two fools are arguing: which of them is smarter. Unfortunately, this is not a metaphor, this is a pathology. <strong>Any humanitarian conflict is evidence of the mental incompetence of the parties.
</strong><br><br>The Centrifuge of Excess or the Third Axiom of Evolution: "<strong>If some find meaning in what is useless for others, everyone is mistaken - only Truth is necessary for everyone</strong>." Therefore, "Russian" is just as useless, if not harmful, for "American", as well as vice versa. And only madness is to argue about what is meaningless for Life.
<br><br><strong>Politics, business, love is self-satisfaction at the expense of agreeing to it. </strong>The more consonants, the sweeter the pleasure. For thousands of years, according to this formula, "printing presses" of national, religious and other replication have been working. Which, in fact, led to Human Hyperinflation.
<br><br><strong>Copying is a prerequisite for survival, but only in the pre-intellectual world</strong>. In the world of Intellect, it is a vital contraindication: in order to get a mold of the process, the process will have to be stopped. Of course, no one was going to die, but also to go to the "apprentices" - too.
<br><br>So <strong>MENTAL COLLECTIVISM</strong> was born. Religion, History, Traditions, Culture, School, Nationalism, Motherland, State, etc. – in many ways lose even to Facebook today. But it was they who became the first «networks» that offered Man: <strong>TO HAVE MORE THAN HE KNOWS</strong>. And Man deceived himself.<br><br>And only after millennia, “suddenly”, it turned out that these puzzles do not add up to a Single Picture. Worryingly, there is a possibility that Man will try to "fit" them with nuclear weapons. Which is absolutely natural when <strong>“Having” is not enough for everyone</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Acquired Ideological Deficiency Syndrome.</strong> Arises in the conditions of Mental Collectivism. It strikes any consciousness, the material possibilities of which are excessive in relation to its intellectual and spiritual abilities.
<br><br>Such a state, when a Person has more than he can, leads to a <strong>malignant monetization of relations</strong>: profit becomes corrupt, laws become subjective; intellectual and spiritual evolution - meaningless; peaceful coexistence of worldviews is impossible.
<br><br>The main and irreversible complication of the Ideological Deficiency Syndrome is <strong>the mental “obesity” of a Human</strong>. In its humanitarian mass, this is a new, but already globally dominant social class, whose social demands exceed its personal productivity.
<br><br>Having chosen the Mental Collectivism as the Matrix of the World Order, the Man parted ways with Evolution in the methods and goals of their main mission. If <strong>Evolution is the achievement of the Unity of Differences</strong>, then Man tries to organize the Unity by erasing any Difference. It has already reached the human gender.
<br><br>If Evolution is a movement from Big to Small to zero line between Excess and Deficit, that is Perfection. That <strong>Collectivism - on the contrary - is a movement from the Small to the Big</strong> in order to dissolve this facet in Excess. And everyone aspires to Paradise.<br><br>If for Evolution each Person is a System equivalent to it, which ensures the survivability of everyone and everyone separately. That for Collectivism, <strong>Man is a replaceable Detail</strong>, whose life outside of Him is already practically impossible - the more expensive the state becomes, man is getting cheaper.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Due to objective incompatibility with the Evolution of the Universe, Mental Collectivism is doomed. It will reach its critical mass by the end of the final confrontation between its monopolists.<strong> The winner will receive the Explosion.</strong> Both the "deaf" and the "mute" will be silenced.
<br><br>Whether Nuclear, Humanitarian or Ecological Explosion - it doesn't matter anymore. With the disappearance of one of the finalists, Peace on Earth will disappear. For a long time. None of the parties is able to master the Humanitarian Legacy of the enemy. <strong>And the first method to avoid the Great Anarchy is not to rush to win.</strong><br><br><strong>The second method is to "legalize" one of the Humanitarian Tranquilizers </strong>as an Ideology of Coexistence of Religions of Nations and Cultures. This will allow you to survive the Explosion. And also, it will give time to restore the Human Rights for his participation in the Evolution of the Universe. Which, in fact, is the Main Condition for the survival of the Intellect in general.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">A Man experiences his first and, in many ways, fatal defeat in Rights when he tries to understand: why does his mother give him up for education in the wrong hands, because even animals do not do this? In this way, in the Lombard of Collectivism, <strong>Parents exchange the Intellect of the Child for freedom from it</strong>. With a surcharge, of course.
<br><br>Then he is absorbed by the “Education System”, which, due to its collectivity, is <strong>not capable of developing personal abilities, therefore it “inculcates” social skills</strong>. This means that a significant amount of energy of the "student" will again be spent not on developing one's own, but on rejecting someone else's.
<br><br>With such an excess of Personal Protest that the World System of Human Socialization generates, <strong>a Spark and an Explosion are inevitable.</strong> Everything that is not from God will leave - it is useless for Evolution: Religion, Nation, Culture, State. Only Man will remain, but under one Condition.&nbsp;<br></p>

De Facto, the Earth belongs to anyone except its rightful Owner. Diogenes also noticed. Fortunately, now the impostors will overthrow themselves. Only those who can become Human will remain. No, it's not about good manners.
<br><br>Intelligence is the only thing that distinguishes a Human from an animal. <strong>Professional Intelligence</strong> is the only Condition for the participation of a Human in the Evolution of the Universe. And the real catastrophe is that this state is unknown to the majority who live according to the Patterns, so they do not use the Intellect at all.
<br><br>Like the Evolution of the Universe, Professional Intelligence moves from Big to Small according to the principle of the Excess Centrifuge: everything that makes sense for some, but meaningless for others, is removed. Unfortunately, for a person everything is exactly the opposite: <strong>some kind of unrestrained flight from the Small to the Big</strong>.<br></p>

That is why <strong>God does not go to rallies and does not sit in chat rooms</strong> - there is no time for Him. We dance and sing. Does this mean that God's works are worse than ours?
<br><br>This means that a World in which a corncob is cheaper than its image - such a World has exhausted itself even in humanitarian perversions, except for nuclear "painting". Although, there is no one to "kill" for a long time - <strong>Mental Collectivism delicately scraped the Man out of the man</strong>.
<br><br>Ideological prostration, political hysteria, national and religious psychoses, paranoid mercantilism are not so much a picture of the World as <strong>"medical" indications</strong> not for a fashionable reboot, but for unpopular fragmentation. The only question is will who carry it out: Evolution or Man?&nbsp;<br></p>
